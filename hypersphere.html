<h2><b><i>HYPERSPHERE</b></i></h2>
<p>
The set of points in Euclidean 4-space having the same distance R from a fixed point P0 forms a hypersurface known as 
a 3-sphere. The hyper-volume of the enclosed space is:</p>

<p>This is part of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric in General relativity where R is substituted by 
function R(t) with t meaning the cosmological age of the universe. Growing or shrinking R with time means expanding 
or collapsing universe, depending on the mass density inside.[14]</p>
