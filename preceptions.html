<h2><b><i>4 DIMENSIONAL PRECEPTIONS IN HUMANS</b></i></h2>
<p>
Research using virtual reality finds that humans, despite living in a three-dimensional world, can, without special practice, make spatial judgments about 
line segments embedded in four-dimensional space, based on their length (one-dimensional) and the angle (two-dimensional) between them.[15] The researchers 
noted that "the participants in our study had minimal practice in these tasks, and it remains an open question whether it is possible to obtain more sustainable, 
definitive, and richer 4D representations with increased perceptual experience in 4D virtual environments".[15] In another study,[16] the ability of humans to 
orient themselves in 2D, 3D, and 4D mazes has been tested. Each maze consisted of four path segments of random length and connected with orthogonal random bends,
 but without branches or loops (i.e. actually labyrinths). The graphical interface was based on John McIntosh's free 4D Maze game.[17] The participating persons
 had to navigate through the path and finally estimate the linear direction back to the starting point. The researchers found that some of the participants were 
able to mentally integrate their path after some practice in 4D (the lower-dimensional cases were for comparison and for the participants to learn the method).</p>

<p>However, a 2020 review underlined how these studies are composed of a small subject sample and mainly of college students. It also pointed out other issues that 
future research has to resolve: elimination of artifacts (these could be caused, for example, by strategies to resolve the required task that don't use 
4D representation/4D reasoning and feedback given by researchers to speed up the adaptation process) and analysis on inter-subject variability 
(if 4D perception is possible, its acquisition could be limited to a subset of humans, to a specific critical period, or to people's attention or motivation).
Furthermore, it is needed to determine if there is a more appropriate way to project the 4-dimension (because there are no restrictions on how the 
4-dimension can be projected). Researchers also hypothesized that human acquisition of 4D perception could result in the activation of brain visual areas and 
entorhinal cortex. If so they suggest that it could be used as a strong indicator of 4D space perception acquisition. Authors also suggested using a variety of 
different neural network architectures (with different a priori assumptions) to understand which ones are or are not able to learn.[18]</p>
