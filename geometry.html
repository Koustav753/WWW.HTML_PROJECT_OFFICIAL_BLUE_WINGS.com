<h2><b><i>GEOMETRY</b></i></h2>
<p>The geometry of four-dimensional space is much more complex than that of three-dimensional space, 
due to the extra degree of freedom.</p>

<p>Just as in three dimensions there are polyhedra made of two dimensional polygons, in four dimensions there are polychora made of polyhedra. In three dimensions, 
there are 5 regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. In four dimensions, there are 6 convex regular 4-polytopes, the analogs of the Platonic solids. 
Relaxing the conditions for regularity generates a further 58 convex uniform 4-polytopes, analogous to the 13 semi-regular Archimedean solids in three dimensions. 
Relaxing the conditions for convexity generates a further 10 nonconvex regular 4-polytopes.</p>

<p>In three dimensions, a circle may be extruded to form a cylinder. In four dimensions, there are several different cylinder-like objects. 
A sphere may be extruded to obtain a spherical cylinder (a cylinder with spherical "caps", known as a spherinder), and a cylinder may be extruded to obtain a 
cylindrical prism (a cubinder).[citation needed] The Cartesian product of two circles may be taken to obtain a duocylinder. All three can "roll" in 
four-dimensional space, each with its properties.</p>

<p>In three dimensions, curves can form knots but surfaces cannot (unless they are self-intersecting). In four dimensions, however, 
knots made using curves can be trivially untied by displacing them in the fourth directionâ€”but 2D surfaces can form non-trivial, non-self-intersecting knots in 
4D space.[13][page needed] Because these surfaces are two-dimensional, they can form much more complex knots than strings in 3D space can. The Klein bottle is 
an example of such a knotted surface.[citation needed] Another such surface is the real projective plane.[citation needed]
