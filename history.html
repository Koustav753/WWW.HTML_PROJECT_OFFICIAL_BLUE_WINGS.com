<h2><b><i>HISTORY</b></i></h2>
<p>
Lagrange wrote in his Mécanique analytique (published 1788, based on work done around 1755) that mechanics can be viewed as operating in a four-dimensional 
space— three dimensions of space, and one of time.[3] As early as 1827, Möbius realized that a fourth spatial dimension would allow a three-dimensional form 
to be rotated onto its mirror-image.[4] The general concept of Euclidean space with any number of dimensions was fully developed by the Swiss mathematician 
Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century, at a time when Cayley, Grassman and Möbius were the only other people who had ever conceived the possibility of 
geometry in more than three dimensions.[5] By 1853 Schläfli had discovered all the regular polytopes that exist in higher dimensions, including the four-dimensional 
analogs of the Platonic solids.</p>

<p>An arithmetic of four spatial dimensions, called quaternions, was defined by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. This associative algebra was the source of the science 
of vector analysis in three dimensions as recounted by Michael J. Crowe in A History of Vector Analysis. Soon after, tessarines and coquaternions were introduced 
as other four-dimensional algebras over R. In 1886, Victor Schlegel described[6] his method of visualizing four-dimensional objects with Schlegel diagrams.</p>

<p>One of the first popular expositors of the fourth dimension was Charles Howard Hinton, starting in 1880 with his essay What is the Fourth Dimension?, published in 
the Dublin University magazine.[7] He coined the terms tesseract, ana and kata in his book A New Era of Thought and introduced a method for visualizing the fourth 
dimension using cubes in the book Fourth Dimension.[8][9] Hinton's ideas inspired a fantasy about a "Church of the Fourth Dimension" featured by Martin Gardner in 
his January 1962 "Mathematical Games column" in Scientific American.</p>

<p>Higher dimensional non-Euclidean spaces were put on a firm footing by Bernhard Riemann's 1854 thesis, Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen, 
in which he considered a "point" to be any sequence of coordinates (x1, ..., xn). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a paper[10] consolidating the role of time 
as the fourth dimension of spacetime, the basis for Einstein's theories of special and general relativity.[11] But the geometry of spacetime, being non-Euclidean, 
is profoundly different from that explored by Schläfli and popularised by Hinton. The study of Minkowski space required Riemann's mathematics which is quite different 
from that of four-dimensional Euclidean space, and so developed along quite different lines. This separation was less clear in the popular imagination, with works of 
fiction and philosophy blurring the distinction, so in 1973 H. S. M. Coxeter felt compelled to write:</p>

<p>Little, if anything, is gained by representing the fourth Euclidean dimension as time. In fact, this idea, so attractively developed by H. G. Wells in The 
Time Machine, has led such authors as John William Dunne (An Experiment with Time) into a serious misconception of the theory of Relativity. Minkowski's geometry of 
space-time is not Euclidean, and consequently has no connection with the present investigation.</P>
