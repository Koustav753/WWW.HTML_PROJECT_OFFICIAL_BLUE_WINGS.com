<h2><b><i>ORTHOGONALITY</b></i></h2>
<p>
In the familiar three-dimensional space of daily life, there are three coordinate axes—usually labeled x, y, and z—with each axis orthogonal 
(i.e. perpendicular) to the other two. The six cardinal directions in this space can be called up, down, east, west, north, and south. 
Positions along these axes can be called altitude, longitude, and latitude. Lengths measured along these axes can be called height, width, and depth.</p>

<p>Comparatively, four-dimensional space has an extra coordinate axis, orthogonal to the other three, which is usually labeled w. To describe the two additional 
cardinal directions, Charles Howard Hinton coined the terms ana and kata, from the Greek words meaning "up toward" and "down from", respectively.[8]: 160 </P>

<p>As mentioned above, Hermann Minkowski exploited the idea of four dimensions to discuss cosmology including the finite velocity of light. In appending a 
time dimension to three-dimensional space, he specified an alternative perpendicularity, hyperbolic orthogonality. This notion provides his four-dimensional 
space with a modified simultaneity appropriate to electromagnetic relations in his cosmos. Minkowski's world overcame problems associated with the traditional 
absolute space and time cosmology previously used in a universe of three space dimensions and one time dimension.</p>
