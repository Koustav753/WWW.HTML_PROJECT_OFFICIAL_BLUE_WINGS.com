<h2><b><i>VECTOR</b></i></h2>
<p>
Mathematically, a four-dimensional space is a space with four spatial dimensions, that is a space that needs four parameters to specify a point in it. 
For example, a general point might have position vector a, equal to</p>

<p>This can be written in terms of the four standard basis vectors (e1, e2, e3, e4), given by</p>

<p>so the general vector a is</p>

<p>Vectors add, subtract and scale as in three dimensions.</P>

<p>The dot product of Euclidean three-dimensional space generalizes to four dimensions as</p>

<p>It can be used to calculate the norm or length of a vector</p>

<p>and calculate or define the angle between two non-zero vectors as</p>

<p>Minkowski spacetime is four-dimensional space with geometry defined by a non-degenerate pairing different from the dot product:</p>

<p>As an example, the distance squared between the points (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,0) is 3 in both the Euclidean and Minkowskian 4-spaces, while the distance squared between (0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,1) is 4 in Euclidean space and 2 in Minkowski space; increasing b4 decreases the metric distance. This leads to many of the well-known apparent "paradoxes" of relativity.</p>

<p>The cross product is not defined in four dimensions. Instead, the exterior product is used for some applications, and is defined as follows:</p>

<p>This is bivector valued, with bivectors in four dimensions forming a six-dimensional linear space with basis (e12, e13, e14, e23, e24, e34). They can be used to generate rotations in four dimensions.</p>
